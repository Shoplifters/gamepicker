# gamepicker

Random game chooser from options in `games.txt`. Does not allow the same game twice in a row. Now pulls from `games.txt` in the Github repo instead of from the local file for synchronization support.

## Build

Install make and SBCL for your system. Then simply run `make` in the `gamepicker` directory and you should be off to the races!
